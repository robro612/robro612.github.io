I am currently a master's student studying CS at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I did my undergraduate degree at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu) where I majored in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/) TA'd two AI courses, and conducted research at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) in the area of neural lexical retrieval.

I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu) where I major in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/). I previously served as a teaching assistant for two core AI courses, 07-180: *Concepts of AI* and 15-281: *AI: Representation and Problem Solving*, at CMU and interned at both Amazon and Meta doing software engineering related to ML recommender systems. Currently, he is conducting research under [Professor Jamie Callan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~callan/) and [Zhen Fan](https://alchemist75.github.io/) at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) in the area of neural lexical retrieval.

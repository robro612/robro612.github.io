I am currently a master's student studying CS at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I did my undergraduate degree at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu) where I majored in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/), TA'd two AI courses, and conducted research at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) in the areas of neural lexical retrieval. Most recently, I interned at [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/) leading the training of their [Jina-ColBERT-v2](jinaai/jina-colbert-v2) model, a multilingual multi-vector retriever.

I'm currently most interested in research in information retrieval and representation learning. My current and previous works have been in the area of efficient and expressive multi-vector retrieval models, and reasoning intensive retrieval tasks.

abstract = {Tip-of-the-Tongue (ToT) retrieval is challenging for search engines because the queries are usually natural-language, verbose, and contain uncertain and inaccurate information. This paper studies the generalization capabilities of existing retrieval methods with ToT queries in multiple domains. We curate a multi-domain dataset and evaluate the effectiveness of recall-oriented first-stage retrieval methods across the different domains, considering in-domain, out-of-domain, and multi-domain training settings. We further explore the use of a Large Language Model (LLM), i.e. GPT-4, for zero-shot re-ranking in various ToT domains, relying solely on the item titles. Results show that multi-domain training enhances recall, and that LLMs are strong zero-shot re-rankers, especially for popular items, outperforming direct GPT-4 prompting without first-stage retrieval.
